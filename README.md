# calendar.c

This program allows the user to manage a weekly activity calendar. It dynamically stores details for each day of the week, such as the day name, date, and activity. The program allows the user to input these details, displays the entire week's schedule, and ensures that memory is properly managed with dynamic allocation and deallocation.

Features

Dynamic Memory Allocation: Memory for day names and activities is allocated dynamically, so it can handle input of varying sizes.
User Input: The program allows the user to input the name of the day, the date, and the activity for each day.
Display the Weekly Schedule: After entering the details, the program displays the week's schedule in a formatted table.
Memory Management: Allocated memory is freed after use to prevent memory leaks.

# stack.c

This repository contains a simple C program that demonstrates basic stack operations, including Push, Pop, Display, and Palindrome Check using a stack data structure. The stack has a fixed size, and the program includes error handling for stack overflow and underflow scenarios.

Features

Push an Element: Allows the user to push an element onto the stack and demonstrates stack overflow if the stack is full.
Pop an Element: Allows the user to pop an element from the stack and demonstrates stack underflow if the stack is empty.
Palindrome Check: Checks if the stack content forms a palindrome, i.e., if the elements of the stack are the same when read forwards and backwards.
Display Stack: Displays the current elements in the stack
