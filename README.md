This program allows the user to manage a weekly activity calendar. It dynamically stores details for each day of the week, such as the day name, date, and activity. The program allows the user to input these details, displays the entire week's schedule, and ensures that memory is properly managed with dynamic allocation and deallocation.

Features
Dynamic Memory Allocation: Memory for day names and activities is allocated dynamically, so it can handle input of varying sizes.
User Input: The program allows the user to input the name of the day, the date, and the activity for each day.
Display the Weekly Schedule: After entering the details, the program displays the week's schedule in a formatted table.
Memory Management: Allocated memory is freed after use to prevent memory leaks.
